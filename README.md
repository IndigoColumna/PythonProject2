# PythonProject2
This is the repository of project 2 for BIMM 143. 
Project 2 is a project for BIMM 143 where students create their own scientific question and hypothesis and perfrom bioinformatics analysis on it. 

Scientific question: How structurally similar are the BRCA1 proteins in mammals such as mice to the BRCA1 proteins found in humans?

scientific hypothesis:  If BRCA1 proteins found in humans and mice are structurally similar, then they will have a similar alignment as well as similar 3D structures.

the files provided are: 
The fasta of the localization domain of both mouse and human as well as the 3D crystal structure of both human and mouse.
