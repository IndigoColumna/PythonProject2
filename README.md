# PythonProject2
This is the repository of project 2 for BIMM 143. 
Project 2 is a project for BIMM 143 where students create their own scientific question and hypothesis and perfrom bioinformatics analysis on it. 

Scientific question: How structurally similar are the BRC1 proteins known for tunmor supression in breast cancer in humans and their closest related promate the chimpanzee?

scientific hypothesis: if BRCA1 proteins found in humans and chimps are the reason for a different amount of cancer rates found between the two primates, then they will be genetically different and structurally different. 

the files provided are: 
the fasta gene files of chimp and human for the BRCA1 gene and the structural pdb file for the brca gene found in human and chimp.
